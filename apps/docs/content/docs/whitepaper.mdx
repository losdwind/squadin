## **The Problem 问题**

![Problems](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/d6a2df6b-c54e-47d8-9c89-64095aa5b3a8/Untitled.png)

Problems

The Web3 space is facing a bottleneck in onboarding new members and pushing forward mass adoption. There are three main reasons, in addition to regulatory issues.

目前除去监管外，主要有三个问题导致Web3大规模采用遇到瓶颈。

### Data Ownership, Discrepency and Privacy, censored and manipulated algorithm 数据所有权、差异和隐私、被审查和操纵的算法

Centralized Web2 platforms have led to data migration barriers and format fragmentation. Current Web2 service providers, especially social networking platforms, lock users onto their platforms, preventing developers from introducing innovative social networking products and features. This lack of flexibility has severely impacted multiple stakeholders, particularly the creator community. They exist at the mercy of platforms and constantly changing business models, not their audiences.

Centralized giants have opaque power and can use user data to maximize profits. Moreover, the programming goal and recommendation algorithm of Web2 social platforms are to increase user engagement time and return on investment. This goal is often achieved at the expense of personal happiness, leading to potential addiction and anxiety. Although recommendation systems still exist in the Web3 space, the key difference is that data ownership belongs to users. Therefore, users can introduce various recommendation models and data analysis service providers to provide information flow according to user preferences.

集中化的Web2平台导致了数据迁移壁垒和格式碎片化。当前的Web2服务提供商，特别是社交网络平台，将用户锁定在平台上，阻止开发人员引导创新的社交网络产品和功能。这种缺乏灵活性对多个利益相关者，尤其是创作者社区造成了严重打击。他们存在于平台和不断变化的商业模式的摆布之中，而不是他们的受众之中。

中心化的巨头拥有不透明的权力，可以使用用户数据来最大化利润。而且，Web2社交平台的编程目的以及推荐算法是增加用户参与时间和投资回报率。这个目标的实现往往以个人幸福感为代价，导致潜在的成瘾和焦虑。虽然推荐系统在Web3空间中仍然存在，但关键区别在于数据所有权属于用户。因此，用户可以引入各种推荐模型和数据分析服务提供者，根据用户偏好提供信息流。

### Lack of Appealing Use Case 缺乏吸引人的使用案例

Since social networks boast the highest number of active internet users, with billions logging in daily, the journey towards the widespread adoption of Web3 technology ideally starts with social media. However, in order to entice users to join Web3 social networks, there needs to be a compelling reason that the Web2 platforms cannot offer. This necessitates the creation of a completely novel social media platform.

每天有数十亿人活跃在社交网络中，Web3技术的广泛采用，最理想情况下应该从社交媒体开始。然而，用户需要一个引人入胜的理由加入Web3社交网络，并且这个社交网络是Web2平台无法提供的。这意味着我们需要基于Web3技术的特点和优势，打造一个全新的社交媒体平台。

### Steep Learning Curve and UI/UX barrier 陡峭的学习曲线和UI / UX障碍

Web3 applications require users to interact directly with complex blockchain technologies. Tasks such as executing transactions through cryptocurrency wallets, securing accounts via private keys, and managing gas fees on a blockchain network are more advanced processes compared to those in the Web2 environment. This complexity can be overwhelming for individuals who are not as familiar with technology.

Furthermore, there are several user experience (UX) issues in the Web3 domain that need comprehensive solutions. For example, managing private keys requires users to remember and maintain a 42-character key, which can be intimidating for many.

In addition, the onboarding process for decentralized applications (dApps) is often overly complicated, particularly for newcomers. This issue emphasizes the need for a simplified and user-friendly approach to enhance the user experience.

The requirement to pay gas fees is another significant obstacle in the Web3 ecosystem. To make the process more accessible and flexible, one potential solution is to provide users with the option to pay these fees using any ERC-20 assets.

Furthermore, the need for users to execute a separate transaction for every on-chain interaction can be time-consuming and expensive. To streamline this process, bundling transactions could be a potential solution.

Lastly, it's essential to highlight the importance of cross-chain interoperability. Currently, users must navigate multiple frontends and bridge UIs, which can be a confusing process. The implementation of cross-chain smart contract calls and transfers could eliminate this problem, paving the way for a smoother user experience in the Web3 space.

Web3应用程序需要用户直接与复杂的区块链技术进行交互。比起Web2应用中的任务，通过加密货币钱包执行交易，通过私钥保护账户以及管理区块链网络上的燃气费用，这些任务更为复杂。这种复杂性可能对不太熟悉技术的个人构成令人生畏的挑战。

此外，UX问题在Web3领域中普遍存在。一个主要例子是私钥管理过程，它要求用户记住并维护一个42个字符的密钥，这对许多人来说可能是令人生畏的任务。此外，分散式应用程序（dApps）的入门过程通常过于复杂，特别是对于新手来说。在Web3生态系统中，支付燃气费用的要求也与现有Web2培养的用户习惯相悖。并且用户需要为每个链上交互执行单独的交易，这既耗时又昂贵，加剧了用户体验的劣化。

最后，需要强调跨链互操作性的重要性。目前，用户必须导航多个前端和桥接UI，这可能是一个令人困惑的过程。实现跨链智能合约调用和转移可以消除这个问题，在Web3空间为更流畅的用户体验铺平道路。

Solutions

### **Project 223**

Project 223 is an open-source tool that collects, standardizes, and stores web2 data on a blockchain with built-in privacy protection. The data is gathered from various sources, including social media, journals, daily activity logs, account bills, passwords, and mHealth data.

By giving users complete control over their data, Project 223 allows them to manage all on-chain data and incorporate different models for different purposes to enhance their lives. For instance, a recommendation model designed to alleviate user anxiety, a notification model tailored to the user's daily routine, and a consulting model that caters to the user's financial situation.

223项目是一个工具，可以将web2数据进行转换、标准化和累积，然后将其放在具有内置隐私保护的链上。数据来自社交媒体、日志、账单、密码、mHealth数据等传统社交图谱。

由于数据完全在用户控制之下，Project 223 允许用户管理所有链上数据，并插入不同目的的不同模型来丰富他们的生活。例如，一个推荐模型专门旨在缓解用户的焦虑，一个通知模型定制到用户的日常习惯，以及一个咨询模型特定于用户的财务状况。

### **Purpose App**

The Purpose App is designed to help users experience their Web3 "Aha!" moment, by allowing them to easily log personal data, participate in or create community data, and share their experiences with others to build their reputation. By analyzing this data, users can gain insights into their talents, character strengths, and potential life purpose, as well as form connections with like-minded individuals who share similar life goals. Ultimately, this can lead to a more fulfilling and prosperous life.

Purpose App旨在通过允许用户记录个人数据、参与或创建并分享数据到社区以获取声誉来为用户带来“惊喜时刻”。此外，基于这些数据，用户可以更好地了解自己的才能、性格优势或潜在的人生目标，找到人生目标的队友，从而实现持续的繁荣生活。

### **Reputake Framework**

We have created a machine learning and AI framework to measure user reputation in the Web3 world. Our decentralized identity and credit rating protocol aims to improve the credit rating system through the use of blockchain technology. Our goal is to empower individuals with control over their own credit data, enabling them to obtain better lending and financial services. Reputake 是一个去中心化的身份和信用评级协议，旨在通过区块链技术改善信用评级体系。他们的目标是让个人能够掌握自己的信用数据，并使用该数据来获得更好的借贷和金融服务。

## **Technical Architecture 技术架构**

### Project 223

Project 223 utilizes artificial intelligence techniques, such as optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing, video processing, and image processing, to extract data from various processes. If an API is provided, webcrawler techniques will be used to gather the necessary information. The data will then be transferred directly to the Lens protocol, complete with appropriate labels and metadata, if the user has an NFT profile. The Lens protocol is a decentralized social network protocol that enables users to perform common social media functions, such as posting, liking, and commenting. It runs on the Polygon chain and does not require any gas fees. However, the Lens protocol does not include mhealth data or store logic for smart home data, so we will need to create a smart contract to handle this additional functionality. Given the volume of mhealth data involved, we may also need to implement a more robust storage solution. Privacy is maintained through the use of the Lit protocol. To minimize the risk of data leaks, the entire application will be built using Electron.

Project 223 利用人工智能技术，例如光学字符识别（OCR）、自然语言处理、视频处理和图像处理，从各种过程中提取数据。如果提供API，则将使用网络爬虫技术收集必要信息。然后，如果用户具有NFT个人资料，则直接将数据传输到Lens协议，包括适当的标签和元数据。Lens协议是一种去中心化的社交网络协议，使用户能够执行常见的社交媒体功能，例如发布、点赞和评论。它运行在Polygon链上，不需要任何燃气费用。然而，Lens协议不包括mhealth数据或存储智能家居数据的逻辑，因此我们需要创建一个智能合约来处理这个额外的功能。考虑到涉及到的mhealth数据量，我们可能还需要实现更强大的存储解决方案。使用Lit协议来维护隐私。为了最大限度地降低数据泄漏的风险，整个应用程序将使用Electron构建。

## **Governance & Tokenomics & STO 社区治理 代币经济 以及权益型代币发行**

Instead of an ICO, we will conduct a Security Token Offering (STO), issuing security tokens that provide token holders with an equity stake in the platform.

The key benefits of shifting to an STO model are:

- Compliance with securities regulations
- Improved legitimacy and reduced legal risks
- Access to larger investor pool, including institutional investors
- Long-term value accrual compared to speculative ICOs

Our STO will issue equity-based security tokens to early investors and community members. Tokens will represent fractional ownership in the platform, providing holders with financial rights including:

- Rights to platform profits/dividends
- Rights to platform sale proceeds
- Voting rights in platform governance

We believe an STO aligns better with the long-term vision of our platform in bringing novel and ethical blockchain-based services to mainstream users.

### Tokenomics

Our platform's tokenomics are designed to incentivize user engagement, reward contributions, and facilitate transactions within the ecosystem. The system now comprises three types of tokens.

1. **Data NFTs (dNFTs):** As a response to privacy and data ownership concerns, users' data on the blockchain will be tokenized as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) termed as Data NFTs (dNFTs). These unique dNFTs represent the ownership of user data within the platform. Each dNFT is bound to a single user, representing their unique data. dNFTs are non-transferable and non-exchangeable, ensuring that a user's personal data remains under their control at all times.
2. **Reputation and Governance Tokens ($RGT):** These tokens will be awarded to users for their active participation and valuable contributions to the platform. The $RGT tokens represent both a user's reputation and their voting power within the ecosystem. The more a user participates in community initiatives and positively contributes to the ecosystem, the more $RGT they earn, which in turn increases their voting power in platform governance.
3. **Purpose Tokens ($PUR):** These tokens serve as the utility tokens within the platform and are used for transactions within the Purpose App and Purpose Model Market. Users can purchase $PUR tokens with fiat or other cryptocurrencies. They can then use these tokens to log personal data, participate in community initiatives, purchase models within the market, and other activities within the ecosystem. The $PUR tokens are also used to incentivize and reward users for their positive actions, such as sharing valuable insights or providing useful feedback.

With this new model, we maintain the strengths of the original tokenomics while simplifying the system and responding to user needs and feedback. This redesign aligns with our commitment to empowering users, preserving data privacy, and fostering a thriving, collaborative community in the Web3 space.

### Governance Structure

Our platform is built on a decentralized governance model, where token holders are the decision-makers. This design is intended to distribute power equitably and ensure that those who are most invested in the platform's success have a significant say in its future.

The key decision-making body of our platform is the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), which operates on the basis of proposals and voting. Any token holder can submit a proposal for a change or feature they'd like to see implemented. These proposals are then put to a vote.

1. **Voting Rights**
    
    Holding $RGT (Reputation and Governance Tokens) grants holders the right to vote on proposals put forth by the community. The more $RGT tokens a user holds, the more voting power they have. This incentivizes active participation in the community, as greater involvement leads to greater influence over the platform's direction.
    
2. **Proposal Creation**
    
    Any $RGT token holder can create a proposal for a change or feature they would like to see. Proposals might involve altering the Reputake algorithm, adjusting a feature of the Purpose App, creating a new model for the Purpose Model Market, or any other change to the platform.
    
    Once a proposal is created, it is put forth to the community for discussion. Token holders can discuss the proposal's merits and drawbacks before voting on it. This ensures a robust and inclusive decision-making process.
    
3. **Voting Process**
    
    After a period of discussion, a proposal is put to a vote. Voting is weighted by the number of $RGT tokens each voter holds. This means that those who hold more tokens, and thus have a larger stake in the platform, have a greater say in its governance.
    
    The result of the vote is determined by a simple majority. If a proposal receives more votes in favor than against, it is passed and will be implemented by the platform's development team.
    
4. Token Holder Rights
    1. **Voting:** $RGT token holders have the right to vote on all proposals put forth to the DAO.
    2. **Proposal Creation:** $RGT token holders have the right to propose changes or features they'd like to see on the platform.
    3. **Earnings:** $RGT and $PUR token holders have the right to earn rewards from their participation in the platform and the community.
    4. **Data Ownership:** Data NFT (dNFT) holders have the right to own and control their personal data within the platform.

Through this governance structure, our platform seeks to empower its users and align the platform's development with the desires and needs of its most active users. This ensures that as our platform grows and evolves, it remains user-centric and responsive to our community's needs.
