Decentralized social media puts control of data and value back in the hands of users and creators. However, the primary focus of any social platform should be facilitating valuable social connections and meeting users' needs.

Our app aims to help people gather squad members for daily casual activities like travel, shopping, gaming and learning. While other apps in this space struggle to retain users or build an initial user base, we have developed a three-pronged approach:

1. Users can log in through both traditional social networks like Twitter as well as decentralized ones such as Lens, Deso. This allows us to maximize quality content distribution and reach users across different communities.
2. Squads can be recommended via social graphs as well as our matching algorithms. Users are rewarded for successful squad referrals, further incentivizing positive network effects.
3. Squads that contribute valuable content over time unlock the ability to sell squad shares. Users can invest in high-performing squads by purchasing shares, with the potential for profits as share prices appreciate. Top squads may eventually issue their own tokens.

By seamlessly bridging online networking and offline coordinated activities, we believe our platform can revolutionize how people connect in person. With a hybrid social approach and innovative token-based features, we aim to solve user retention challenges faced by other apps and build a thriving community around shared real-world experiences. Your original core ideas around hybrid social logins, squad matching and monetization remain intact. Please let me know if any part of this revised summary could still be improved.

	<AccordionContent>
Our goal is to have a multi-platform presence to maximize reach and interconnectivity. Initially, users will be able to log in with their Twitter accounts to gain access to a large existing user base.

We will also integrate with decentralized social protocols like Lens to enable gasless social interactions like likes, comments and sharing. This allows us to bridge centralized and decentralized networks.

Moving forward, support for additional platforms such as Deso, CyberConnect, Farcaster and subreddits will be added.

What do you mean "squad"?
</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent>

In the context of our product, a "squad" refers to a small group of users collaborating on an activity. Squads are intended to be intimate teams comprising 3 to 5 carefully selected members. This limited size helps foster tighter bonding and camaraderie between participants as they coordinate and carry out shared real-world experiences together.
